- abstract: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are energy-intensive
    facilities that play a critical role in meeting stringent effluent
    quality regulations. Accurate prediction of energy consumption in
    WWTPs is essential for cost savings, process optimization,
    regulatory compliance, and reducing carbon footprint. This paper
    introduces an efficient approach for predicting energy consumption
    in WWTPs, leveraging deep learning models, data augmentation, and
    feature selection. Specifically, Spline Cubic interpolation enriches
    the dataset, while the Random Forest model identifies important
    features. The study investigates the impact of lagged data to
    capture temporal dependencies. Comparative analysis of five deep
    learning models on original and augmented datasets from Melbourne
    WWTP demonstrates substantial performance improvement with augmented
    data. Incorporating lagged energy consumption data further enhances
    accuracy, providing valuable insights for effective energy
    management. Notably, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
    Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) models achieve Mean
    Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values of 1.36
